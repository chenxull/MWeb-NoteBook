### [237\. Delete Node in a Linked ListCopy for MarkdownCopy for Markdown](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/28/237_example.png)

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

**Note:**

*   The linked list will have at least two elements.
*   All of the nodes' values will be unique.
*   The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
*   Do not return anything from your function.

### 思路
题目给的信息有限，没办法获取到待删除节点的前节点。所以可以采用赋值的方式，将待删除节点的后续赋值给待删除节点，然后将待删除节点的后续给删除即可。
### Solution

Language: **Go**

```go
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * type ListNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Next *ListNode
 * }
 */
func deleteNode(node *ListNode) {
    next := node.Next
	node.Val = next.Val

	node.Next = next.Next
}
```
