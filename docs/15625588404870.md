## [621\. Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks. Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative cooling interval **n** that means between two **same tasks**, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.

You need to return the **least** number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

**Example:**

```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
```

**Note:**

1.  The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
2.  The integer n is in the range [0, 100].


### 思路
比较复杂的一题，具体的解析过程可以参考这个[连接](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/discuss/104500/Java-O(n)-time-O(1)-space-1-pass-no-sorting-solution-with-detailed-explanation)

### Solution

Language: **Go**

```go
func leastInterval(tasks []byte, n int) int {
    if n == 0 {
		return len(tasks)
	}

	res := [26]int{}
	//  统计每个任务出现的次数
	for _, c := range tasks {
		res[c-'A']++
	}

	//  寻找其中出现次数最多的任务

	most := 0
	for _, num := range res {
		if num > most {
			most = num
		}
	}

	// 至少存在idle 的数量
	idles := (most - 1) * (n + 1)

	for _, num := range res {
		idles -= min(most-1, num)
	}
	return len(tasks) + max(0, idles)
}
```
