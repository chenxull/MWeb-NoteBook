# 垃圾回收官方注释

1. GC 执行扫描进程
    1. STW，这将导致所有的 P 到达 GC 安全点
    2. 


 The finalizer goroutine is kicked off only when all spans are swept.
 When the next GC starts, it sweeps all not-yet-swept spans (if any).

 GC rate.
 Next GC is after we've allocated an extra amount of memory proportional to
 the amount already in use. The proportion is controlled by GOGC environment variable
 (100 by default). If GOGC=100 and we're using 4M, we'll GC again when we get to 8M
 (this mark is tracked in next_gc variable). This keeps the GC cost in linear
 proportion to the allocation cost. Adjusting GOGC just changes the linear constant
 (and also the amount of extra memory used).

 Oblets

 In order to prevent long pauses while scanning large objects and to
 improve parallelism, the garbage collector breaks up scan jobs for
 objects larger than maxObletBytes into "oblets" of at most
 maxObletBytes. When scanning encounters the beginning of a large
 object, it scans only the first oblet and enqueues the remaining
 oblets as new scan jobs.
