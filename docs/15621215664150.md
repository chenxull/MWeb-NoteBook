## [62\. Unique PathsCopy for Markdown](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


A robot is located at the top-left corner of a _m_ x _n_ grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

<small style="display: inline;">Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?</small>

**Note:** _m_ and _n_ will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1\. Right -> Right -> Down
2\. Right -> Down -> Right
3\. Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28```

### 思路

动态规划解题，找出路径的规律
### Solution

Language: **Go**

```go
func uniquePaths(m int, n int) int {
    //  用来存储每个位置的路径数量
	path := [100][100]int{}

	//  想要到达第一排和第一列的路径只有一条
	for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
		path[i][0] = 1
	}
	for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
		path[0][j] = 1
	}

	for i := 1; i < m; i++ {
		for j := 1; j < n; j++ {
			path[i][j] = path[i-1][j] + path[i][j-1]
		}
	}
	return path[m-1][n-1]
}
```
