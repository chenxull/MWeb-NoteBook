### [63\. Unique Paths II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


A robot is located at the top-left corner of a _m_ x _n_ grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** _m_ and _n_ will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1\. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2\. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```
### 思路
整体解决方案和 62 题一样，只需要加上判断条件即可。

### Solution

Language: **Go**

```go
func uniquePathsWithObstacles(obstacleGrid [][]int) int {
    
}
```
