### [26\. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


Given a sorted array _nums_, remove the duplicates such that each element appear only _once_ and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}```

### 思路
本题要求不适用额外的空间，给出数组独立元素的个数。

一把这种类型的题目使用双指针来进行，一个用来遍历，一个用来记录处理的数据。
### Solution

Language: **Go**

```go
func removeDuplicates(nums []int) int {
    if len(nums) == 0 {
		return 0
	}

	i := 0
	for j := i; j < len(nums); j++ {
		if nums[j] != nums[i] {
			i++
			nums[i] = nums[j]
		}
	}
	return i + 1
}
```
