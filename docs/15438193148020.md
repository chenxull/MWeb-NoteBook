## splitting apps into microservices

splitting complex monolithic appli- cations into smaller independently deployable components called microservices. Each microservice runs as an independent process (see figure 1.1) and communicates with other microservices through simple, well-defined interfaces (APIs).

微服务之间通过HTTP,RESTful，AMQP等通信协议进行通信。在升级或部署新的微服务时，只要确保通信API不变即可。
