### [416\. Partition Equal Subset Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


Given a **non-empty** array containing **only positive integers**, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

**Note:**

1.  Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
2.  The array size will not exceed 200.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]

Output: true

Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]

Output: false

Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
```

### 思路

经典的动态规划题目，属于01 背包问题。

This problem is essentially let us to find whether there are several numbers in a set which are able to sum to a specific value (in this problem, the value is sum/2).

Actually, this is a 0/1 knapsack problem, for each number, we can pick it or not. Let us assume dp[i][j] means whether the specific sum j can be gotten from the first i numbers. If we can pick such a series of numbers from 0-i whose sum is j, dp[i][j] is true, otherwise it is false.

Base case: dp[0][0] is true; (zero number consists of sum 0 is true)

Transition function: For each number, if we don't pick it, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j], which means if the first i-1 elements has made it to j, dp[i][j] would also make it to j (we can just ignore nums[i]). If we pick nums[i]. dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-nums[i]], which represents that j is composed of the current value nums[i] and the remaining composed of other previous numbers. Thus, the transition function is dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i-1][j-nums[i]]

dp[i] 中存储的就是 和为 i 的元素是否存在 ，下面的示意图可以帮助理解。

### Solution

Language: **Go**

```go
func canPartition(nums []int) bool {
    sum := 0
	for _, v := range nums {
		sum += v
	}
	if sum%2 != 0 {
		return false
	}
	dp := make([]bool, sum+1)
	dp[0] = true
	for _, num := range nums {
		for i := sum; i >= 0; i-- {
			if dp[i] {
				dp[i+num] = true
			}
		}
		if dp[sum/2] {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}
```
